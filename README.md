## PROJECT NAME:
 HR Analytics: A Complete Employee Data Analysis Project using Power BI Dashboard
# About Project
This HR Analytics project using Power BI is designed to help HR managers and business leaders analyze and monitor employee data effectively. The goal is to support data-driven decisions related to employee retention, development, and recruitment.
            The dashboard provides key insights such as:
Attrition trends and overall attrition rate.
Employee distribution by gender, age group, education field, and job satisfaction level.
Department-wise and role-wise analysis to identify where attrition is highest.
Interactive features like filters and drill-down options allow HR managers to explore the data in detail and focus on specific employee groups. This makes it easier to track patterns, compare performance, and plan strategies to reduce attrition and improve employee engagement.

## Conclusion
From the HR Analytics Dashboard, we found that:

- **Education field** and **job role** also affect attrition  

This dashboard makes it easier to track attrition and understand employee behavior, helping HR teams take data-driven actions.
